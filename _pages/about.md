I am a graduate student at [Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute](https://www.rpi.edu/) (RPI). My research focuses on the analysis and optimization of coupled nonlinear electromechanical energy harvesting systems, integrating applied mathematics and dynamical systems, control theory, and scientific machine learning techniques.
